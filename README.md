# hello-world
First GitHub repository for CS136

Hello! In terms of things about myself, I don't have much coding experience, outside of the very limited time I spent on html
and Java in high school, along with CS134 last semester. However, the gratification of tackling a problem and producing
sufficient code to solve that problem is what I enjoy most about CS, and I hope to eventually major in it.
